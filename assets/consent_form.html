        <div><strong>Purpose of the experiment</strong></div>
        
        <div>To determine how we perceive and think about others in a social context: what information do we get from perceiving
            others, do people agree about this information, and what do we do with this information?</div>
        
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        
        <div><strong>What will I be doing?</strong></div>
        
        <div>The computer is going to present you with photos of faces. You’re going to make judgments about these faces, as
            instructed to you on the computer screen or by the experimenter.</div>
        
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        
        <div><b>How long will it take?</b></div>
        
        <div>The study should take approximately 10 minutes.</div>

        <div><strong>What are the benefits?</strong></div>
        
        <div>The benefit of this study is that you will be learning about social contexts and person perception. Once you have
            completed the study,&nbsp;the ideas behind this research will be explained in further detail. If you’re interested,
            let us know and we can&nbsp;send you a copy of our findings once the study is complete.&nbsp;</div>
