<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you so much for participating in today’s study! We really appreciate you taking the time to contribute to our
    scientific understanding of the way that we perceive and think about people.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span style="font-weight: 700;">About the Study</span>

<p>Background: Previous research has shown that people's judgments of attractiveness are affected by social group
    membership; whether or not we think someone is attractive can depend on what groups we belong to, as well as what
    groups we think the other person belongs to. Here, we showed you pictures of different faces and asked you how
    attractive they were and whether you thought the person was liberal or conservatives; we also asked you some
    questions about your own sexual orientation. We will use this information to study how sexual orientation affects
    judgments of attractiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Withdrawal from the Study</span></p>

<p>You may request to have your information or any part of your responses withdrawn from the study. If you would like to
    do so, it is important that you let us know as soon as possible. Because we work so hard to protect the privacy of
    experimental participants’ data, it will be virtually impossible to know which data was yours if you decide that you
    would like to withdraw at a later date. If you do decide to withdraw, you will still receive compensation for your
    time and will not be penalized or punished in any way. You don’t even have to say why, and we promise not to pry.
